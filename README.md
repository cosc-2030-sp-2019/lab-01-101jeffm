For Lab 01:  Process Numbers and Compress Data
Because a four-byte zero would represent that color black in this program, it would not be wise to use that as a flag for this program because the flag could then be easily misinterpreted as just another color in the file. It would be better to use a flag that would not represent any color on the RGB spectrum (such as just a 0) so that no misinterpretation would be likely.
